A powerful suicidal unit that splashes heavily with no dropoff is not to be underestimated.\n          Banelings can also be dropped from overlords over a mineral line or the opponents army very effectively.  Due to their bonus against structures, only 5 Banelings are needed to bust through supply depots, making them easy targets when parts of the Terran''s wall.  The term ''Baneling Bust'' refers to their use as quick destructors of protective walls, followed usually by a flood of Speedlings.\n          Banelings should be controlled carefully and separately, and mobile enough to retreat and wait for an opportunity to surround or flank unsuspecting armies." +
                " Any attempt to restrict the movement of the opposing army, such as with the spell Fungal Growth, usually works well with Banelings, allowing them to more easily and quickly connect with their targets.', '          Banelings are created from zerglings following a brief chrysalis phase. In the new form, the zergling''s claws shrivel and become withered, and a swollen sac filled with volatile chemicals grows out of its back. The zergling''s skin is repurposed, stretching over newly formed growths while its bone plates soften to hold bulbous, pulsating acid sacs in place. Though the remains of the carapace offer no real protection, they allow for unhindered delivery of the baneling''s payload. The digestive and reproductory tracts are assimilated as nutrients to accelerate the process, and make room for the fleshy, mutated adrenal glands. These are re-purposed to produce and store large quantities of highly corrosive acid. Few materials can withstand this acid burst.\n" +
                "          Because of its mass, the baneling''s legs are thicker than the zergling''s, in order to stabilize itself. Its feet are replaced by sharp spikes that allow them to navigate rough terrain, albeit at a slower pace. The Swarm was able to increase the baneling''s speed despite these imperfections. Yet due to their bloated nature, banelings are barely able to walk. They have been observed to tuck into a ball and roll. Banelings also possess a rudimentary sonar system—Dominion scientists have theorized that this is a degeneration of the zergling''s complex optical structure. This system consists of a transmitter in the center of the baneling''s skull, along with two evenly spaced receivers to the sides. The transmitter emits pulses that map the baneling''s surrounding area, and echoes back to the receiver, feeding the baneling with a continuous stream of spatial information.\n          Banelings were first observed during the Siege of Cask on Sorona, in 2503. Its defenders held out against the zerg long enough so that it came to pass that only minor breeds such as zerglings continued to be spawned to be sent into battle. However, queens drove the development of a new strain, via zerglings incorporating an acidic native mold into themselves. These new banelings were thus sent against Cask, their spray of acid destroying its defenses and eradicating the terrans present.\n" +
                "          During the same year, when other terrans encountered the baneling for the first time they thought it was a mutation of a previously unknown genus rather than a morph of the zergling. The baneling was duly added to the list of threats and scientists began an effort to develop chemical rounds to detonate banelings prematurely.\n" +
                "          In 2505, Abathur used the baneling strain as a base for a mutation upgrade to the mutalisk, allowing its glaive wurms to explode on impact. After joining Kerrigan, Dehaka would selectively breed his pack to create similar strains of creatures among the primal zerg.\n" +
                "          Baneling acid sacs were harvested for use in Project Simulant in the project''s attempt to recreate the baneling in robotic form. The engineers had to deal with the sacs constantly melting through the surrounding plate infrastructure.

                "           Initial deployment within the Dominion was disappointing. The aircraft was judged as too inflexible, and many were relegated to minor roles with backwater militias. Over time, ease of interstellar deployment, the ability to deliver strikes over difficult terrain, and the addition of the cloaking device, led to more widespread deployment within the Dominion. The Banshee gained a reputation as a Dominion terror weapon due to collateral damage caused in urban combat (a result of the craft''s poor guidance systems for its backlash rockets).

It also serves as backup in emergency situations, such as the need to effect a blind jump, which is a very risky endeavor, to retreat from a hot zone.

This allowed the Daelaam to arm their carriers with automated drones that could do the same types of repairs, greatly enhancing the longevity of their carriers.

This trait made it a candidate for the arsenal of the Purifier program, and colossi developed for the Purifiers were considered the ultimate purification machines. Its full destructive power was demonstrated by the mass slaughter carried out against the kalathi, appalling the protoss. As such, the Conclave outlawed the manufacture of colossi, and existing machines were deactivated before being sealed away. Some were sent to distant asteroids and uninhabited moons. Others were stored on Aiur, some underwater, awaiting a reactivation signal. They weren''t reactivated in time for the war on Aiur because it would take too long.\n\n" +
                "          The war against the zerg, however, prompted the return of the colossi to the protoss arsenal. In 2503, the protoss began collecting them using coordinates collected from a preserver, despite misgivings.\n\n" +

If not, a rival ascendant has been eliminated.\n\n" +
                "          During the Second Great War, the Tal''darim deployed colossi on worlds such as Xil and Atrias. Several of their colossi were refitted with charged pulse blasters to eliminate priority targets, and renamed as wrathwalkers.\n\n" +
                "          In 2504, Dark Prelate Zeratul traveled to Aiur and reactivated some colossi as part of a mission to study the body of the deceased Overmind. Later that year the Tal''darim used them as well in their defense of a xel''naga temple on Xil.\n\n" +

Colossi developed by the Purifier program were later added to the Daelaam arsenal, employing more destructive incendiary weaponry than their Khalai counterparts.

                "          The Nerazim, or the Dark Templar as they are known to outsiders, are a number of protoss tribes who shun the Khala.\n\n" +
                "          The story of the Dark Templar begins when a few rogue tribes refused to submit to the Khala, believing that their individual identities would be erased to further promote the rule of the Judicator Caste. Although they were not hostile or militant, they believed that the communal agenda of the Conclave would be the eventual doom of the protoss. The rogues held no ill-will toward their brethren and attempted to live their lives unnoticed as best they could. Nonetheless their existence was known to the Conclave. They were joined further by individuals from other tribes who did not follow their kin''s embrace of the Khala. More Nerazim stemmed from the Sargas Tribe than any other Khalai tribe.\n\n" +
                "          Approximately one thousand years before the Great War, the Conclave, under the leadership of Kortanul, had collected records on the locations of the Rogues. The Conclave ordered the Executor Adun to report to the Conclave so they could tell him about this new threat, which they believed could cause a new Aeon of Strife. Adun was given Raszagal, a young prisoner, to question. He brought her to the Citadel of the Executor so the other Templar could question her. The Conclave gave him their information so he could quietly track down the rogues, abduct them, and execute them.\n\n" +
                "          Adun was unable to bring himself to execute the Rogues. He transmitted fake recordings of the executions to the Conclave and hid the Rogues, even teaching them how to cloak. The Rogues ended up developing these abilities more quickly than Adun could teach them. Unfortunately, the Rogues, still learning their powers, lacked the discipline of the Khala. They inadvertently unleashed psionic storms, which spiraled out of control on Aiur. The Conclave discovered the corpses of dead Rogues, only to realize these Rogues had been depicted in the execution recordings.\n\n" +
                "          The Conclave could neither punish Adun nor slay the Rogues, as he would force them to publicly admit the existence of the Rogues. The Conclave decided to banish the wayward Rogues from Aiur forever on an ancient, but functional xel''naga ship, along with other protoss ships which Adun insisted they be allowed to take with them. However, last-minute squabbling threatened the Rogues—Kortanul attacked Adun, prompting a psychic battle between the Rogues and the Conclave—and Adun feared the Rogues might accidentally create psionic storms again. Adun created a blue mist with a combination of Khala and strange energies, which covered and protected the Rogues. However, the power caused Adun to burn out like a star. They then took the name Nerazim, to signify that they were now a new tribe of the protoss, united in their exile\n\n" +
                "          Shortly afterward it was discovered that the exiles had stolen the powerful Khalis crystal from the Sargas Tribe and taken it with them.\n\n" +
                "          The Nerazim ceremoniously cut off their nerve cords to show their disdain for the Conclave and the Judicator. This act cut them off from the Khala, forcing them to draw their psionic energies from the Void. Forevermore they would be known as the Dark Templar, as they had forsaken the Khala''s light. After leaving Aiur, they adopted the name \"Nerazim,\" to give name to the new tribe that had formed from the exiles. As their legend spread across Aiur, sparking the imaginations of many young protoss, this tale worked to incriminate them. Although they were hunted and feared by their own brethren, the Nerazim never abandoned their love of Aiur and worked to safeguard it in any way they secretly could. During this time the creation of the dark archon was banned.\n\n" +
                "          During their exile from Aiur, the Nerazim were free to experiment with new technologies. They developed their fleet of corsairs; vessels designed to defend themselves as they had traveled through the stars. On board the xel''naga ship they had been exiled on, the Nerazim were able to gain access to new knowledge, which helped them create warp blades.\n\n" +
                "          Into the Stars: \n" +
                "          The first step on the Dark Templar''s journey was the moon of Ehlna, which they discovered shortly after leaving Aiur. It had a xel''naga-crafted warp gate, so the exiled protoss stayed. They discovered the moon had a combination of energies which altered khaydarin crystals, making them quite efficient at storing memories. Without preservers, the Dark Templar had no other way to store memories, so they used this technological means. After more than two centuries, the Dark Templar departed, but some remained to operate a shrine, the Alys''aril, where the memories could be extracted from pilgrims and stored. Numerous vessels remained behind as well.\n\n" +
                "          Upon finding a xel''naga temple on Shakuras, the Dark Templar decided to remain there to study it.\n\n" +
                "          Struggling to adapt to their harsh and nearly lightless environment (protoss feed on light), the Rogue Tribes altered their skills and even their biology to cope. The abilities that Adun had taught them served them well on their adopted homeworld, and their culture flourished. Some tribes would live in other star systems and aboard small ships.\n\n" +
                "          During this time, both the Khalai and Nerazim fought a running conflict with one another. In 2497, Nerazim terrorists attacked a Conclave tower during the celebration of Khas''mas. Praetor Fenix fought through the terrorists, and slew them with their own warp blades.\n\n" +
                "          Eventually Raszagal, age 1045 in 2500 and one of few Dark Templar who was old enough to clearly remember Aiur, became Matriarch of the Dark Templar. She ruled for approximately five hundred years before the outbreak of the Brood War.\n\n" +
                "          Culture:\n          Driven by individuality and a thirst for knowledge, the Nerazim developed along a very different path than the Khalai. Nerazim work in smaller groups than the Khalai, and are far more individualistic. With a less monolithic culture, each Nerazim is encouraged to forge their own path, and they believe that fostering this attitude leads to their great successes. They remain willful and often fiercely independent, with their closest allegiance being first to clannish warrior bands and then to the Nerazim, the great tribe to which all Dark Templar belong. By their nature the Nerazim are a diverse group of freethinkers motivated by their regard for one another and tribal bonds rather than abstract notions of authority. As such, many Nerazim develop skills outside their chosen professions, unlike in the strict caste system of the Khalai. Examples include some of their engineers also having knowledge in combat. Different clans take great pains to distinguish themselves through variations in weapons, armor, markings, and dress. Regardless of clan, reputation and personal responsibility are paramount in the eyes of any Nerazim: individuals must always be accountable for their actions. As a result, deeds rather than words act as the Dark Templar''s guide. Individual clans can be prone to feuding and rivalry, but they are quick to band together against a common threat, such as that presented by the zerg. Family is important to the Nerazim, and the family unit is part of their social structure. They are less demonstrative than the Khalai when it comes to the display of emotion.\n\n" +
                "          The Nerazim sever their nerve cords in order to fully separate themselves from the Khala. To prevent energy bleed, the Nerazim put clamps on the cut cords. This severing leads to a weakness where Void energy channeled through the exposed nerve chords can knock a Nerazim unconscious, serving as a nonlethal way to incapacitate a Nerazim warrior.\n\n" +
                "          The Nerazim maintained the same system of writing as the Khalai. Unlike the Khalai however, female Nerazim are able to become figures of authority. Some Khalani phrases are exclusive to the Nerazim''s vocabulary, while others that are also used by the Khalai have a different meaning to the Nerazim than their counterparts.\n\n" +
                "          The xel''naga retain the position of \"gods\" in Nerazim religion. They consider anything that \"taints\" the Void to be unholy. Funerary rites are conducted for the deceased. Some, if not all Nerazim appear to store their dead in mausoleums and crypts.\n\n" +
                "          Before officially becoming a Dark Templar, one undergoes a Shadow Walk.\n\n" +

Drones move by hovering above the ground using a float bladder (factoring this in, a drone stands nearly as tall as a terran wearing CMC armor). This peculiar organ emits a low-frequency energy field that disrupts gravity around the drone. The creature then \"swims\" through the air by undulating its body and using some of the excess energy as a means of propulsion. Dedicated analysis by Terran Dominion scientists has revealed that the aforementioned membrane is capable of expanding rapidly with a proper source of nourishment (e.g. creep). However, the gashyrr wasps'' worker caste''s ability to secrete compound B-5801 was maintained in a sense through genetic trimming and manipulation, allowing the drones themselves to become the biological focus of zerg structures.

Dominion engineers used an experimental paristeel/bonded carbide weave (lighter and better insulated) to protect operator and machine from the incredibly high temperatures of the napalm spray. Additional heat-shielding, made from an expanding and re-forming material, was installed under the hellion''s chassis.

The original incarnation of the infernal flamethrower was ineffective in close quarters, and installing a second weapon on an already taxed chassis proved unfeasible. To solve the issue, handy hellbat operators added a home-made, manually activated system, albeit useful only in walker mode as it reduces effective range, to pump polystyrene foam into the barrel of the infernal flamethrower prior to firing. The foam alters the density of the plasma fuel, which increases the flame''s intensity when ignited. This makes it very deadly against unarmored or lightly armored targets. This foam system is now standard issue in all Dominion hellbats.\n\n" +

However, at the advice of Grand Preserver Rohana, these attempts were halted, in favor of keeping the more traditional and focused split between the psi blade wielding zealots and the psionic power wielding high templar.\n\n" +
                "During the End War in 2506, all high templar were forced to cut their nerve chords and sever themselves from the Khala or fall to Amon''s corruption, a loss that was not easily borne. In spite of this, in their race''s darkest hour they continued to hone their abilities, enhancing the power of their psionic storms and learning how to channel their power into the plasma shields of their allies.\n\n" +

While slothiens were peaceful herbivores, the hydralisk is noted as being one of the most fierce and sadistic of the zerg strains.

                "          Hydralisks are covered in armored plates. The average hydralisk in 2499 was 5.4m long, 2.1-3.5m tall, and weighed anything from 390 kg to 3500kg. At \"cruising speed,\" they could move from 13-24 kph. The hydralisks of this era were smaller and leaner than the creatures that would follow them, which also possess tri-bladed scythes instead of the single ones used by the hydralisks of the Great War and Brood War. Despite their relatively sluggish nature, hydralisks can climb vertical surfaces and continued evolution of the strain through muscular augmentation through genetic manipulation has resulted in faster hydralisks, increasing their locomotion by up to 25%, both on and off creep. Hydralisks muscles and tendons are strong and impenetrable by a number of weapons, but have the flexibility of leather. Dominion Intelligence Section published reports that hydralisks had a weak spot in their head, though many marines attest to such a weak spot being the creature''s chest.\n\n" +
                "          The hydralisk''s endocrine and adrenal were altered as part of their evolution. The chemicals pumped into their bloodstream effectively force them to live in a perpetual \"fight response.\" Some hydralisk variants seem to be able to overcharge their specialized endocrine system, substantially increasing aggression and savagery. As the backbone of the Swarm, hydralisks are subject to constant evolutionary improvement.\n\n" +
                "          Prior to the beginning of the Brood War, hydralisks gained the ability to mutate into lurkers. Hydralisks changed drastically in the transition to the Second Great War, and evolved more bone claws as well as a bulkier figure. During the Second Great War, the ability of hydralisks to metamorphose into lurkers was temporarily lost. The Leviathan Brood was the exception, due to the inherent link between hydralisks and lurkers within the brood. After the End War, some hydralisks were given the essence of the noxious strain of ultralisks, giving them new toxic abilities and changing their appearance.\n\n" +
                "          By the Battle of Adena, the hydralisks of the Niadra Brood possessed a different physique from their Swarm counterparts, being longer, slimmer, and possessing shorter, less curved scythes. They fired their spikes from their hands rather than their upper carapace plates. The first recorded encounter between terrans and hydralisks was aboard a cargo vessel. The hydralisk was recorded by the derelict ship''s security cameras. Since then, hydralisks have established themselves in terran culture to a notable extent. Sometimes colloquially called \"hydras,\" hydralisk skulls have been mounted akin to trophies in Joeyray''s Bar and on an ore loader on Sorona. The Annual Hydralisk Derby has also become an established event.\n\n" +

They are outfitted with two twin phase disruptors as their primary attack form; they give critical fire support to legions of zealots against ground targets, deployed when the protoss are faced with heavy enemy firepower. These blasts can easily punch large holes in heavy plating, but their limited field of fire prevents Immortals from engaging aerial targets. When deployed, immortals give critical support by eliminating enemy artillery and ranged attackers.\n\n" +
                "          Immortals are equipped with armor weave that mitigates impacts through energy dissipation. Additionally, the hardened shields used by immortals are created by intertwining spectrums and wavelengths of varying intensity. Through this, these shields are incredibly dense, able to mitigate powerful impacts such as siege tank rounds or the blades of an ultralisk, through energy dissipation. When the remaining dragoons were turned into immortals, the protoss decided to outfit them with these shields in an attempt to further preserve their most ancient and venerable warriors. Originally, the shields only activated when struck by powerful attacks, which left immortals more vulnerable to the pinprick attacks of lesser foes. By 2505, immortal shields were heavily reinforced, making the immortal invulnerable to enemy attack for short periods of time. These shields were impractical for mass production.\n\n" +

This honored tradition was broken by the fall of Aiur when the shrine dedicated to dragoon creation was infested by the zerg. Following the Brood War, crippled templar were transplanted into the new immortal exoskeletons instead. The first were in service by 2502. The remaining dragoons were transformed into immortals. As a result, immortals house some of the most skilled and venerable warriors of the protoss military.\n\n" +
